    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 (16oz) bags coleslaw mix, shredded cabbage and carrot</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar, sub distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger powder</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 lb egg roll wrappers</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2-3 cup vegetable oil, for frying so make sure there's about at least 1-2 inches of oil in the pan</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up 2 teaspoons of sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>
            Add the coleslaw mix, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic powder, ginger powder, and green onion to the hot
            skillet and saute for 5-8 minutes until the cabbage has softened stirring occasionally. (Don't over cook the
            cabbage because it will have a mushy texture after you fry).
        </li>
        <li>Lay out the egg roll wrappers in batches and place 1/3 cup of the cabbage filling in the center.</li>
        <li>Brush the edges with water, then roll them up like a burrito making sure all of the edges are sealed.</li>
        <li>Set the egg rolls aside (don't stack them because they will stick together!).</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet or heavy dutch oven over medium high heat until the oil reaches roughly 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Carefully place 4-6 egg rolls at a time in the hot oil adjusting the heat of the oil so it stays at roughly 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Fry for 5-8 minutes flipping the egg rolls so they are crispy all over.</li>
        <li>Place the crispy egg rolls on a wire rack to cool so they stay crispy.</li>
    </ol>
